auto it = map.upper_bound(key): 
returns an iterator pointing to 1st element in the map that is strictly greater than the key. 
If no such element is found, it returns the iterator map.end()

Thus to get the key, it--

auto it = map.lower_bound(key): 
returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the map that is not less than key. 
If all elements in the map are less than key, it returns map.end()
